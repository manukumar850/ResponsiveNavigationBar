I have made a responsive Navigation bar.
The visibility of the bar changes as the display size changes. Now a days it is very neccessary to make the sites responsive bacause of increasing smartphone uses.
Most of us uses the the smartphone for various purposes, so it is very much important to give the user the best experience so that they can use our sites.
